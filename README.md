**Project 3 Description:** 

Make Jenkins report whether there are newly passing tests or newly failing tests based on historical information. On every run, Jenkins will only report on all the tests that pass and/or those that fail. The goal of this project is to use information from previous runs so that Jenkins can also report on which tests were passing before, but are now failing (or vice-versa).
